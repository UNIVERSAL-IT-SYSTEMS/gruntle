<title>a text-based MMORPG engine</title>

<h3>What is it?</h3>

thickishstring is a text-based MMORPG engine with a lightweight web-browser
client.

The client uses Javascript/HTML with a WebSockets connection to the server
so it's fast and responsive --- if you're used to accessing AJAX websites
you'll be astounded at how fast it is. The server is written in Python using
SQLite as the database backend; it's fast, lightweight, and should be very
portable. 

Right now it's in an incredibly rough prototype stage, but there's enough here
to let you log in, move around, talk to other players, create your own realms
and let other players play them.

This is where the source code and what we shall try to laughingly call 'the
documentation' is stored. If you want to actually <i>try</i> it, you probably
want <a href="http://cowlark.com/~dg/thickishstring">the test server</a>
instead. It may even be running.

<h3>Where can I get it?</h3>

Right now you'll need to check it out of the source repository using
<a href="http://fossil-scm.org">the Fossil DVCS</a>. Use the
following commands:

<verbatim>mkdir thickishstring
cd thickishstring
fossil clone http://cowlark.com/thickishstring thickishstring.fossil
fossil open thickishstring.fossil
</verbatim>

Alternatively, you can download a snapshot of the current development version
(there is, right now, no stable version):

More installation instructions are in the README.
