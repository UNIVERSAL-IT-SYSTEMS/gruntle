<title>The LambdaMOO prototype server</title>

The Python version of the server is actually the second version. The
original prototype was written as a LambdaMOO application server, using
<a href="http://stunt.io/">Stunt</a> as the server. It worked really well,
but design changes meant that it no longer fitted the design of thickishstring
and so it got rewritten.

Thanks to the magic of version control systems, the source is still available;
it makes an interesting example of using LambdaMOO/Stunt as a pure app
server, rather than as a traditional MUD.

Look at the <a href='../../../dir?ci=moo'><code>moo</code></a> branch of the
VCS, or else download a snapshot as follows:
