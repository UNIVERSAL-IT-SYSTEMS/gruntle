	<h1>API reference: callbacks</h1>

	<p>
		thickishstring will try to call special subroutines in your room
		script when things happen. You can implement these to add behaviour.
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<p><a id="RoomDescription"><code>RoomDescription</code></a></p>
			<p>
				Returns a markup object describing the current room. This is
				used to show the player the current room description. This
				must be present.
			</p>
			<p>
				Note that this subroutine <i>returns</i> the room description,
				rather than directly telling the player! This subroutine should
				have no side effects and should not actually change anything.
			</p>
		</li>

		<li>
			<p><a id="Actions"><code>Actions</code></a></p>
			<p>
				Returns a list of <a href="#Action">Action</a> objects
				describing the actions currently available to the player.
			</p>
			<p>
				This subroutine should have no side effects and should not
				actually change anything.
			</p>
			<p>
				If this is not present, no actions appear in the tab at the
				bottom of the screen (although they can appear as links in
				the room description).
			</p>
		</li>
	</ul>
