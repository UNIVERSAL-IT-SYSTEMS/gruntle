	<h1>Creating a realm</h1>

	<h2>Creation</h2>
	<p>
		Creating a realm is easy: pick <b>Your Realms -> Create New Realm</b>
		A new, empty realm will be created for you and you'll be warped to it.
	</p>
	<p>
		It's currently not possible to delete a realm, but you can create
		as many as you like (for now).
	</p>

	<h2>Editing</h2>
	<p>
		When you're inside a realm that you own, the Realm Editor window
		will automatically appear. This shows a list of all the rooms in
		the realm. The realm name is shown at the top; clicking on the
		green hand icon will allow you to change this.
	</p>
	<p>
		You can use the realm editor to create and destroy individual rooms,
		as well as warping directly to a specific room.
	</p>
	<p>
		See the help entry on <a href="rooms.html">Rooms</a> for more
		information about editing rooms.
	</p>

	<h2>Inviting people in</h2>
	<p>
		What's the point of creating a realm of your own if people can't
		play in it?
	</p>
	<p>
		The user interface for doing this is currently very crude. Sorry.
		Go to your realm; make a note of the instance number displayed on
		the left side of the title bar. Tell your friends this number.
	</p>
	<p>
		Now your friends can connect to thickishstring and enter this number
		in the <b>Warp -> Warp To Instance</b> dialogue. They will then warp to the
		entrance of your realm.
	</p>
