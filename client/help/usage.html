	<h1>Basic Usage</h1>
	<h2>Introduction</h2>
	<p>
		thickishstring is a choose-your-own-adventure multiplayer game
		engine. You can use it to explore worlds other people have written
		in association (or possibly versus) your friends (or enemies). Or
		you can create your own worlds and let people play them.
	</p>
	<p>
		Playing it is simplicity itself: the column of text on the left
		side of the screen describes what's happening; the tab at the
		bottom shows what you can do here. Click in a link to perform the
		action. Links may also appear in the text itself.
	</p>
	<p>
		You can talk to other people in the same room as you by clicking on
		the white box at the bottom of the screen and typing. When you press
		RETURN, what you've typed will be shown to other players.
