	<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

	<h2>Help! I'm lost!</h2>
	<p>
		There's at least one special realm you can always warp to: see the
		Warp menu. If you get stuck somewhere, you can use this to get home
		again.
	</p>
	<p>
		Plus, if you warp to a specific instance when you're already in it,
		you'll be taken back to the entrance of the realm.
	</p>

	<h2>Realms? Instances?</h2>
	<p>
		A <i>realm</i> is a world written by a specific author.
	</p>
	<p>
		Each realm may have one or more <i>instances</i>, which are
		simultaneous copies of the realm running in parallel. This allows
		multiple people (or groups of people) to explore the same realm
		without running into each other.
	</p>
	<p>
		Right now there's no mechanism for creating new instances, so each
		realm has exactly one instance. If you look at the title bar the
		game will tell you the ID of the instance you're currently inside.
		To warp to another realm, you'll need the author to tell you the
		instance ID of it; you can then use the Warp To Instance item in
		the Warp menu to go there.
	</p>
	<p>
		This is horribly crude and unutterably nasty. It'll be made better
		at some point. Please bear with me.
	</p>

	<h2>What happens when I log off?</h2>
	<p>
		Nothing much.
	</p>
	<p>
		When you log back on again, your character will still be in the same
		room (provided the author hasn't removed the room, kicked you out,
		rewritten the realm, etc). When logged off, your character isn't
		visible to other players.
	</p>

	<h2>Can I customise my character?</h2>
	<p>
		Not yet. Right now all players have is their names. They don't have
		descriptions and they certainly don't have sex.
	</p>
	<p>
		This will be fixed at some point.
	</p>

	<h2>What happens if I try to log in twice?</h2>
	<p>
		You only have one character, so you can only be logged in once. If
		you try to connect more than once, your old connection will be
		automatically disconnected.
