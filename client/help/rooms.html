	<h1>Editing rooms</h1>

	<h2>Introduction</h2>
	<p>
		Rooms are where all the action is in thickishstring. Er, literally.
	</p>
	<p>
		Rooms can be created via the Realm Editor window. Just click on the
        <b>[add room]</b> button and you'll get a new room. To destroy a
		room, click on the red X next to the room name. (Important! This will
		destroy <i>everything</i> in the room, without asking, and you won't
		be able to get it back.)
	</p>
	<p>
		Each room has a <i>title</i>, which is the name shown to players; and
		it has a <i>name</i>, which is a short name used by the system to
		identify the room. The realm editor shows names. Names are <i>not</i>
		shown to the player. You can change the name and the title as much as
		you like, and they don't need to be anything like each other. You
		can even have multiple rooms in a realm with the same name but it's
		not recommended.
	</p>
	<p>
		The room called <code>entrypoint</code> is special; you can't delete
		it or change its name (but you can change its title). This is the
		entrance to your realm, and is where players will go if they warp
		in. Players can't warp anywhere else in your realm. To get to other
		rooms, they have to walk.
	</p>

	<h2>Room scripts</h2>
	<p>
		To make a room actually do something, you need to write a script
		describing the room's behaviour. This uses a simple dialect of Basic
		called ThickBasic. See <a href="thickbasic.html">the ThickBasic
		help page</a> for details. It's a proper programming language, so
		your rooms can be quite complicated. However, your code does get a
		set amount of time in which to run. If your script takes to long, it
		will be terminated, to prevent abuse of the server.
	</p>
	<p>
		Each script defines a number of subroutines which return information
		about the room. When players move around or perform actions, these
		subroutines are called to actually do the work. See
		<a href="api_callbacks.html">the API reference</a> for a description
		of these.
	</p>
	<p>
		It is intended that there will be a simple editor available for
		people who don't need complex behaviour, and just want to write
		rooms that consist of a room description and some simple actions.
		Unfortunately this isn't ready yet. Sorry.
	</p>
	<p>
		It's possible for scripts to store variables in the thickishstring
		server itself; this allows persistent state (such as whether a lever
		has been pulled, and that sort of thing). These variables are shared
		among all rooms in an instance. They are <i>not</i> shared between
		multiple instances of a realm.
