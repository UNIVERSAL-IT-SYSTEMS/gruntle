	<h1>API reference: markup</h1>

	<p>
		ThickBasic markup represents text that is going to be shown to the
		player. Objects and expressions can be embedded in markup
		which are rendered specially. For example, player names are
		highlighted.
	</p>
	<p>
		Markup look like strings, although delimited with double quotes:
	</p>
	<pre>
m1 = "Hello, world!"
</pre>
	<p>
		Markup can span multiple lines. If there is a blank line, that is
		treated as a paragraph break. Otherwise, whitespace is all collapsed.
	</p>
	<pre>
m2 = "This is
  all on one
    line.

But this is another paragraph."
</pre>
	<p>
		To embed an expression, use curly braces. The expression will be
		evaluated and the value converted to a markup object.
	</p>
	<pre>
count = 3
m3 = "The number of the counting is {count}."
</pre>
	<p>
		Markup can be concatenated with <code>+</code>. It is also possible
		to embed markup inside markup. <i>m4</i> and <i>m5</i> in the
		following are equivalent:
	</p>
	<pre>
if male then greeting="Sir" else greeting="Madam"
m4 = "Good day, {greeting}."
m5 = "Good day, " + greeting + "."
</pre>
	<p>
		Markup is immutable, and the contents cannot be read in any way.
		(Because sometimes the content will depend on the player's browser
		settings, and the server doesn't know those.)
	</p>
