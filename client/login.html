<p>Incredibly basic instructions follow:</p>
<p>Stuff in red dotted boxes can be edited. A box will light up red when it
contains uncommitted changes --- press RETURN (or look for a save button) to
do this.</p>
<p>Things that look like #99 refer to instances of a realm. You can give these
to your friends (if you have any) so they can visit your realms. You can have
multiple instances of the same realm running at once, but the UI doesn't allow
you to create them yet, so there's only one per realm.</p>
<p>Error reporting is poor. Really poor. If you try to do something and nothing
whatsoever happens, that's probably an error. Try your local Javascript
console.</p>
