INTRODUCTION
============

gruntle, previously known as thickishstring, is a text-based MMORPG engine
based on Google Drive.

It uses Google Drive's real-time collaboration features for communication
between users --- a world is just a file in your drive account; share it
with your friends and they can play. It allows multiple authors, any number
of players, and doesn't require you to run a backend server to make it all
work.

Right now it's in an incredibly rough prototype stage.



TO BUILD
========

It uses ninja to build and npm and bower for the Javascript toolchain. To
build it:

      npm install
	  ninja

...and the distribution package will be in the dist directory.

On the other hand, if you have a web browser with ES6 support, you can just
load src/index.html in a web browser and it'll just work.



TROUBLESHOOTING
===============

The Google Drive Realtime debugger is your friend.



MORE INFORMATION
